    </h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        6-8 cups chopped vegetables (used sweet potato, potato, carrot, peppers
        and zucchini)
      </li>
      <li>3 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Dressing</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic (crushed)</li>
      <li>Juice of 1/2 an orange</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Salad ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup baby spinach leaves</li>
      <li>1/2 cup crumbled feta</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 200°C/390°F. Add the chopped vegetables to a large
        mixing bowl and add the olive oil, oregano, garlic powder and season
        generously with salt and pepper. Toss to coat and spread in a single
        layer on a baking tray lined with a silicone liner or baking paper. Bake
        for 30 minutes or until the vegetables are cooked.
      </li>
      <li>Add all dressing ingredients to a jar and shake well to combine.</li>
      <li>
        Add the roasted vegetables, spinach leaves and feta to a large serving
        bowl. If serving immediately, pour over the dressing (you may not need
        all of it) and toss to combine. If you are going to serve the salad in a
        day or 2, leave the dressing off and keep it in the fridge along with
        the salad and pour over about 30 minutes before serving. Salad will keep
        in the fridge for several days.
